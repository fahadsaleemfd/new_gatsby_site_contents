title: GOD IS THE ROOT NODE
text: >-
  I’ve been “born again”. Well at least that’s what I’ve deduced from
  researching my condition and talking to people who are in the know. I used to
  be embarrassed to pledge any allegiance to God despite enthusiastically
  sharing my reasoning for a Creator after a couple of drinks when the subject
  arose and the Big Life questions unfurled. You know the ones – why are we
  here? Are we the only life in the universe? What is consciousness? I’d vouch
  for the complexity of molecular biology and how so many of a cell’s components
  need to exist simultaneously for everything to function. It defies logic that
  such a system could “evolve”. For the molecule, DNA, to spontaneously arise
  from a bubbling of chemical constituents in a primordial soup and manage to
  encode the blueprint for a whole organism is laughable, nevermind the enzymes
  and molecular machinery required to transcribe, translate and replicate it.
  “Yeah but when you factor in the billions of years… anything is possible!”
  “It’s impossible for us to grasp the timescale this occurred at” are the main
  counterpoints. Which is fair enough. I wasn’t there at the creation of the
  universe, in the world described in Genesis or the “big bang” which is more
  palatable for materialists. Francis Crick, arguably not the discoverer of DNA
  (Rosalind Franklin is) but the understander of its significance devoted a
  whole book to this topic: *Life Itself: It’s Origin and Nature* where he uses
  an analogy of a billion monkeys typing on a typewriter from the creation of
  the universe to this moment in time and never by chance coming up with an
  exact string of letters that would compose a coherent nucleotide code for a
  living organism, be it even the simplest life form such as prokaryotes e.g.
  bacteria. Embarrassing on retrospection is an earlier blog post where I
  entertained panspermia and the notion of DNA being a molecule that fell from
  space to seed life on Earth. So close, yet so far. Francis Collins, who led
  the Human Genome sequencing project has written a book in the same vein
  called *The Language of God* but takes it a step further in suggesting DNA was
  created. 


  So using my tiny brain and gut I had intuitively and somewhat deductively reasoned that our world was created. Subconsciously I knew something was up, a zombie process was running in the background but I never searched for it to validate its requirement. I’d known this for quite some time. Yet something kept me from having a relationship with Him. I didn’t even *know*  I could actually have a connection with God. That’s mental, right?! Um, no, not if you’re a Christian or a member of the ~50% of the population who practises monotheism. It’s all there in the Good Book. I used to roll my eyes and grow weary at Christians prattling off bible verses. My Mum would tell me what’s playing out before us is all in the bible. I thought they were simple-minded to place complete autonomy on a single book, the words of which went over my head and lulled me to sleep whenever I tried to read them. I thought they were crazy. The irony of this doesn’t escape me as I reflect on how insane my contrary belief system was and the autonomy I’d place on calculating planetary angles.


  I observed the zeal and fortitude Christians had and I *wanted* to understand. I wanted to be part of the club but Jesus wasn’t the trendy option and I had to try on every other theology before landing on Christ. I’d absentmindedly swipe away the daily Bible verse notification without reading it. I had a friend who prayed for me to turn to the faith and tried to pull me into the Light. He invited me to join an Alpha Chrisitanity course hosted by his parish. My attendance waned, I hummed and hawed, I didn’t like the vibes of the alpha course creator and questioned his motives, as well as the motives and sanity of my friend. Who would even invite me on such a thing? I judged the whole charade to be a brainwashing program run by a cult. I wouldn’t mind but I’d already had 2 run-ins with God before this program, but I was too stubborn to submit. Lost, blind and prideful is a bad combination. I guess it didn’t help that the Alpha course corresponded with my time on the PhD residential training program where my science peers didn’t exactly make the greatest soundboards to bounce theology off. “Do you believe?” they’d mock and I’d be embarrassed and say “I’m not sure”, regretting ever mentioning it. I’ve no one to blame but myself, as I too knelt at the altar of science. For my birthday my “friends” got me a card which said “good friends and crazy friends make the best memories”. It’s been a lonely road to redemption.
